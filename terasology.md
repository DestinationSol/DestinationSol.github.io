<a href="https://terasology.org/">Terasology</a> is a super extensible open source voxel-based
game made by the maintainers of Destination Sol. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming
a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world.
<br>
<br> From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and
modular game. We host a large amount of modules under the
<a href="http://github.com/Terasology">Terasology</a> organisation, and
many more which are maintained by individual enthusiasts. We welcome new
ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions
from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on
<a href="https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC">IRC</a> or
<a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>.
<br>
<br> The creators and maintainers are a diverse mix of software developers,
designers, game testers, graphic artists, musicians and even a few
open source loving high schoolers. We encourage and appreciate contributions
from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to
newcomers.
<br>
<br> Terasology is fully open source and is licensed under the Apache 2.0
license for code and under CC BY 4.0 for artwork (see credits for some
minor exceptions).

<br> If you have any questions or if you just want to chat, do drop by our
IRC channel on freenode, #terasology, or use this invite for our <a href="https://discord.gg/4uKbB8J">Discord</a>.
