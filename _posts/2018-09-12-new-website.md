## New Website!

If you have visited our website before you might notice something different now. Yep, we have some more things!
Our new website was built on a desire to improve upon the prior splashsite and is now powered by Jekyll, which enables us to do some pretty nice things without too much difficulty.

### Cool things!
 - One of those things is a blog (yay!) so stay tuned for our cool posts coming in the future.
 - Another is an easily managable image gallery! With Jekyll we can add images without a single line of code.
 - Our new website is also reponsive meaning that it will adapt to your screensize, giving you the best experience no matter the device you use.

Do know that this is an ongoing project, so it will not be perfect but please feel free to let us of any issues in our [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/DestinationSol/DestinationSol.github.io/issues)
