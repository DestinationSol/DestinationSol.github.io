## New Website!

If you have visited our website before you might notice something different now. Yep, we have some more things!
Our new website was built on a desire to improve upon the prior splashsite and is now powered by Jekyll, which enables us to do some pretty nice things without too much difficulty.

### Cool things!
 - One of those things is a blog (yay!) so stay tuned for our cool posts coming in the future.
 - Another is an easily managable image gallery! With Jekyll we can add images without a single line of code.
 - Our new website is also reponsive meaning that it will adapt to your screensize, giving you the best experience no matter the device you use.
