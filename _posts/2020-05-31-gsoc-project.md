Hi everyone! This summer for Google Summer of Code, I'll be refactoring the Destination Sol code to use Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, so that it'll be easier to build upon and modify. I'll be creating an ECS-based version of what is currently the SolObject interface. I'll use that to refactor asteroids, ships, and more. My project starts on June 1 and ends on August 24. I'll post here about my progress every other week.

This is a helpful explanation/tutorial of ECS: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Entity-System-Architecture
