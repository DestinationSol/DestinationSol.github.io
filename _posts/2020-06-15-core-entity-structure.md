	Hello everyone! Over the past two weeks, I have been developing a framework for implementing [Entity-Component-System](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Entity-System-Architecture) architecture in Destination: Sol. The plan was to have it finished by today, but I am slightly behind schedule. I hope to be caught up by the middle of this coming week.

	This coming week, I will be implementing ECS for the construction of asteroids. Once I finish, developers will be able to easily create asteroids using the ECS framework, which is one step closer to easy development and modding. 

	The week after, I will do the same for the Transcendent object, which is the object that represents a player when they go through a StarPort. That code is particularly tangled, so I want to clean it up to make future development easier. I'll post again about my progress in two weeks.
